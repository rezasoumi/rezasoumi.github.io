# Computer Engineer

I'm a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, one of Iran's premier institutions, ranked as the best university in the country according to the QS ranking of 2023.

Throughout my academic journey and especially towards the end, I've developed a keen interest in machine learning and deep learning techniques. My fascination with these cutting-edge technologies has driven me to watch various projects and try to explore some of them by myself to apply my knowledge in practical ways.
You can explore these projects in detail on my GitHub page.

As a technology enthusiast, I firmly believe in the importance of staying updated with the latest advancements in the field. I am an avid reader of research papers and actively participate in online courses and workshops to expand my knowledge.

I am excited to embark on a career journey that allows me to apply my skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence to create innovative solutions that positively impact society. I'm eager to contribute my expertise to a dynamic and forward-thinking team.

I'm open to connecting with like-minded professionals, researchers, and industry experts. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email.

## Work Experience
**Data Engineer & ML Specialist @ Mofid Securities (_Sep 2020 - Present_) (Part-Time during my education)**

During my tenure at Mofid Securities, I held a tripartite role as a Software Engineer, Data Engineer, and Machine Learning specialist, contributing to the success of innovative projects in the realm of Machine Learning.
- _Software Engineer Responsibilities:_ As a Software Engineer, I focused on developing visualization methods and integrating Telegram APIs to create a dynamic Telegram bot. This bot served as a central platform for the visualization and accessibility of data generated by the Machine Learning project named DeepNext which was portfolio recommender for Iran's Stock Exchange. Additionally, I played a key role in enhancing the core website of the DeepNext project, implementing new features using Angular and the Dotnet framework. These enhancements provided stakeholders with easier access to the valuable insights derived from DeepNext's portfolio analyses for Iran's stock exchange.
- _Data Engineer and Machine Learning Specialist Responsibilities:_ As a Data Engineer and ML specialist, I actively participated in data collection and transformation processes. I skillfully acquired data from diverse sources and utilized Machine Learning or Deep Learning methods to enhance data precision and comprehensiveness. For instance, I employed the spline method to estimate and recover missing data points. Notably, I efficiently converted one-minute stock prices into 15-minute intervals, effectively reducing data volume while maintaining its accuracy. Additionally, I conducted testing on a segment of the training data for the DeepNext Machine Learning project.

Throughout my time at Mofid, I leveraged my expertise in Software Engineering, Data Engineering, and Machin Learning / Deep Learning knowledge to tackle complex challenges, foster collaboration within the team, and deliver impactful solutions with real-world applications in the financial domain.

## Last Projects
### Modern Information Retrieval
[Repository](https://github.com/rezasoumi/ModernInformationRetrieval)

The project focuses on various techniques for document classification, search and retrieval, clustering, and other advanced retrieval methods using python programming language. Each phase is described below along with the implemented techniques and evaluation metrics. This project is made through the course of Modern Information Retrieval of Dr. Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah.

### Machine Learning Notebooks
[Repository](https://github.com/rezasoumi/MachineLearningNotebooks)

This repository contains the source codes and implementations (using python) of various machine learning algorithms completed during the Machine Learning course at Sharif University of Technology (Prof: Seyed Abolfazl Motahari). Each section represents a different topic or technique covered in the course, and the projects demonstrate practical applications of the algorithms. Linear Regression, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Lasso & Ridge Regression, Decision Tree and Ensemble Techniques, Polynomial Regression & Spline, SVM, PCS, K-Means, Neural Net, Semantic Analysis Project are all available in the GitHub repo.


### Signals & Systems Project
[Repository](https://github.com/rezasoumi/Signals-Systems-Project)

The Signals and Systems course project at Sharif involves two main aspects: JPEG compression and the development of a system to counteract the impact of a noisy channel during image transmission. more details are available in the GitHub repo.

### Secure Messanger
[Repository](https://github.com/rezasoumi/DNS_Project)

This project is a secure messenger application designed to provide end-to-end encryption for communication between users in a command prompt environment. Users can send messages securely to each other, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of their conversations. The application utilizes RSA and Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish secure communication channels. more details are available in the GitHub repo.

### Another Projects
I have a collection of projects available in my GitHub repository that I completed during my bachelor's journey. These projects include an Internet of Medical Project(IOMT), a Cooking Website Project, a Decaf Compiler Project, a Python Interpreter, and a Simple Telegram bot.
