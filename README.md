## Research Experience
** Continuous-Time Neural Networks @ Sharif University (_Sep 2023 - Present_)**

[Project Objective](https://github.com/rezasoumi/LiquidTimeConstantNeuralNetwork#project-objectives): Investigating applications and potential enhancements of Continuous-Time Neural Networks, both in theory and practice.

I am actively engaged in two research papers: "Liquid Time-Constant Neural Network" and "Closed-form Continuous Time Neural Network" collaborating under the guidance of [Dr. Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S1U0KlgAAAAJ&hl=en)

These projects delve into the dynamic realm of neural networks and continuous-time modeling, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach. The scope spans dynamic systems, control theory, numerical computation, mathematics, linear algebra, engineering probability, and statistics, as well as expertise in machine learning and deep learning.

## Work Experience
** Software/Data Engineer & ML Specialist @ Mofid Securities (_Sep 2020 - Sep 2023_) (Part-Time during my education)**

During my tenure at Mofid Securities, I held a tripartite role as a Software Engineer, Data Engineer, and Machine Learning specialist, contributing to the success of innovative projects in the realm of Machine Learning.

- _Software Engineer Responsibility_, Enhancing the core website of the DeepNext project, implementing new features using Angular and the Dotnet framework. This website served as a central platform for visualizing and accessing data generated by the DeepNext Machine Learning project, a portfolio recommender for Iran's Stock Exchange.
- In my role as a _Data Engineer and Data Scientist/Machine Learning specialist_, I actively participated in data collection and transformation processes, contributing to the development of machine learning models. I skillfully acquired data from diverse sources and employed Machine Learning methods to enhance data precision and comprehensiveness. For example, I used the spline method to estimate and recover missing and corrupted data points to increase the performance of the model and efficiently converted one-minute stock prices into 15-minute intervals, reducing data volume and enhancing computational efficiency without significantly compromising predictive accuracy. Additionally, I contributed to the continuous improvement of the portfolio recommendation model, addressing various challenges to create the most effective solution.

Throughout my time at Mofid, I leveraged my expertise in Software Engineering, Data Engineering, and Machine learning / Deep Learning knowledge to tackle complex challenges, foster collaboration within the team, and deliver impactful solutions with real-world applications in the financial domain.

## Last Projects

### Patient monitoring device (IOMT)
In progress ...

The aim of this project is to explore the application of the Internet of Medical Things (IOMT) in healthcare, with a focus on creating a prototype patient monitoring device for an elderly individual with Alzheimer's. The device incorporates sensors for monitoring vital signs such as pulse oximetry, heart rate, and blood pressure, along with a GPS sensor to track the patient's location. The key challenge lies in designing a portable, low-power device. Sensor data is transmitted to an internet server via Raspberry Pi or NodeMCU Wi-Fi modules, using IoT protocols like MQTT or CoAP. The project also includes the development of a mobile or web application for real-time sensor data display.

### Modern Information Retrieval
[Repository](https://github.com/rezasoumi/ModernInformationRetrieval)

The project focuses on various techniques for document classification, search and retrieval, clustering, and other advanced retrieval methods using python programming language. Each phase is described below along with the implemented techniques and evaluation metrics. This project is made through the course of Modern Information Retrieval of Dr. Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah.

### Machine Learning Notebooks
[Repository](https://github.com/rezasoumi/MachineLearningNotebooks)

This repository contains the source codes and implementations (using python) of various machine learning algorithms completed during the Machine Learning course at Sharif University of Technology (Prof: Seyed Abolfazl Motahari). Each section represents a different topic or technique covered in the course, and the projects demonstrate practical applications of the algorithms. Linear Regression, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Lasso & Ridge Regression, Decision Tree and Ensemble Techniques, Polynomial Regression & Spline, SVM, PCS, K-Means, Neural Net, Semantic Analysis Project are all available in the GitHub repo.


### Signals & Systems Project
[Repository](https://github.com/rezasoumi/Signals-Systems-Project)

The Signals and Systems course project at Sharif involves two main aspects: JPEG compression and the development of a system to counteract the impact of a noisy channel during image transmission. more details are available in the GitHub repo.

### Secure Messanger
[Repository](https://github.com/rezasoumi/DNS_Project)

This project is a secure messenger application designed to provide end-to-end encryption for communication between users in a command prompt environment. Users can send messages securely to each other, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of their conversations. The application utilizes RSA and Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish secure communication channels. more details are available in the GitHub repo.

### Another Projects
